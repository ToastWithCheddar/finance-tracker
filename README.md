```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd finance-tracker

# 2. Start development environment (creates .env automatically)
./scripts/dev.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
# Create .env from example (has safe development defaults)
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services in development mode
docker-compose up --build
```
