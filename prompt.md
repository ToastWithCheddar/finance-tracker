Here I have functional analysis of the project with daily planing to organize the development. Suppose that you are an expert software engineer, I am doing an internship and I need your critiques for the further development, I want you to extract the week plans in chronological order, then first read the documentation files in the folder "docs" (you might want to insert entire folder into your context window), after that understand the structure of the code files for corresponding section. When you are done with the analysis in the documents, you need to find the location of the files that are mentioned in the each document. 

When you are reading the documents, pay attention to:
- Which features haven't completely, partially or not even implemented? Then update the plan I provided to you, you can make this by telling me directly or writing into a document named as "plan_updates.md". 
- Are there problematic designs, architecture choices, bugs, errors (all kinds of but especially syntax), cross-dependency issues ? I am aware of that this is a very broad task, but try to be thoughtful and follow the list:

## Output Requirements

After completing this checklist, create a `plan_updates.md` file with:

1. **Executive Summary**
    - Overall project health assessment
    - Critical issues that need immediate attention
    - Recommended priority for fixes
2. **Feature Implementation Status**
    - Week-by-week breakdown of actual vs planned completion
    - Missing features that should be added to the plan
    - Features that need to be moved to different weeks
3. **Critical Issues Found**
    - Architecture problems that need redesign
    - Security vulnerabilities that must be fixed
    - Performance bottlenecks that need addressing
    - Cross-dependency issues blocking development
4. **Recommended Plan Updates**
    - Specific changes to daily task assignments
    - Additional days needed for incomplete features
    - Reordering of tasks based on dependencies
    - Risk mitigation strategies for identified issues
5. **Next Steps**
    - Immediate actions required
    - Long-term architectural improvements
    - Testing and validation requirements
    - Documentation and knowledge transfer needs

  ! Write the documentation extremely, precise and detailed
