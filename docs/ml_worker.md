### ML Worker Analysis

The `ml-worker` directory contains the core components for the machine learning service responsible for transaction categorization. It leverages modern ML techniques, including sentence transformers, ONNX for optimized inference, and a robust production orchestration system with A/B testing and monitoring.

#### 1. Core Components and Technologies

*   **`ml_classification_service.py`**: This is the heart of the ML worker. It implements the `TransactionClassifier` class, which performs transaction categorization.
    *   **Sentence Transformers**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for generating embeddings of transaction descriptions. This model is downloaded and stored locally.
    *   **Few-shot Learning**: Initializes category prototypes by averaging embeddings of example transactions for each category. This allows the model to categorize new transactions by finding the closest prototype in the embedding space.
    *   **Cosine Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to determine the closeness between a transaction embedding and category prototypes.
    *   **Confidence Levels**: Assigns confidence levels (low, medium, high) based on the similarity score.
    *   **User Feedback**: Collects user feedback to improve model accuracy over time.
    *   **ONNX Export**: Supports exporting the model to ONNX format for optimized inference.
    *   **Quantization**: Integrates with ONNX Runtime to perform INT8 quantization (dynamic and static) for further performance gains and reduced model size.
*   **`optimized_inference_engine.py`**: Implements `OptimizedInferenceEngine` for high-performance, low-latency inference.
    *   **ONNX Runtime**: Utilizes ONNX Runtime for CPU-optimized inference.
    *   **Batch Processing**: Supports batch classification for higher throughput.
    *   **Embedding Cache**: Caches embeddings of frequently encountered texts to reduce redundant computations.

    *   **Statistical Analysis**: Performs statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, z-tests) to compare variant performance on success metrics (accuracy, inference time).
    *   **Guard Rails**: Implements safety thresholds to automatically pause or stop experiments if performance degrades significantly.
    *   **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive experiment reports with recommendations.
*   **`onnx_converter.py`**: Handles the conversion of Sentence Transformer models to ONNX format and applies quantization.
    *   **ONNX Export**: Exports PyTorch models to ONNX.
    *   **Optimization**: Applies ONNX graph optimizations.
    *   **Dynamic Quantization**: Performs dynamic INT8 quantization.
    *   **Static Quantization**: Performs static INT8 quantization using calibration data for higher accuracy.

*   **`worker.py`**: This is the Celery worker entry point.
    *   **Celery Integration**: Configures and runs the Celery worker, defining tasks for transaction classification, feedback collection, model updates, and health checks.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing**: All ML tasks are executed asynchronously via Celery, allowing the main application to remain responsive.
    *   **Production Orchestrator Initialization**: Initializes the `ProductionOrchestrator` on worker startup, setting up the entire ML serving pipeline.

    *   **Dependencies**: Installs system dependencies (build-essential, libpq-dev, curl, git) and Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Work Directory**: Sets `/app` as the working directory.
    *   **Non-root User**: Runs the worker as a non-root user (`worker`) for security.
    *   **Health Check**: Includes a health check to ensure the Celery worker and classifier are operational.
    *   **CMD**: Runs the Celery worker with specified concurrency and logging levels.

*   **`download_model.py`**: A utility script to download the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model locally.

#### 2. Data Flow and Interactions

1.  **Model Training/Update**:
    *   The `ml_classification_service.py` initializes `category_prototypes` from default examples.
    *   User feedback (`collect_feedback` task) and new category examples (`add_category_example` task) are collected.
    *   The model can be updated (`update_model_from_feedback` task) by recomputing prototypes based on this feedback.
    *   Prototypes are persisted using `pickle` files (`models/category_prototypes.pkl`).
2.  **Model Optimization and Deployment**:
    *   The `onnx_converter.py` converts the PyTorch `SentenceTransformer` model to ONNX format (`export_model_to_onnx` task).
    *   It then applies dynamic or static INT8 quantization to the ONNX model.
    *   These optimized ONNX models are stored in `models/production/`.
3.  **Production Orchestration**:
    *   On worker startup, `worker.py` initializes the `ProductionOrchestrator`.
    *   The orchestrator loads the optimized ONNX models into `OptimizedInferenceEngine` instances.
    *   It runs initial performance benchmarks on all loaded models.
    *   If A/B testing is enabled, it sets up an experiment using `ab_testing_framework.py`, assigning traffic to different model variants.
    *   `model_monitoring.py` starts collecting real-time metrics and checking for alerts.
4.  **Transaction Classification (Inference)**:
    *   When a `classify_transaction` task is received by Celery, the `ProductionOrchestrator` determines which model variant to use (based on A/B test assignment).
    *   The selected `OptimizedInferenceEngine` performs the classification, leveraging ONNX Runtime, batch processing, and caching for low-latency inference.
    *   Inference results (predicted category, confidence, inference time) are returned.
5.  **Monitoring and Feedback Loop**:
    *   Inference metrics are recorded by `ModelMonitor`.
    *   User feedback on categorization is collected (`collect_user_feedback` task) and used to improve the model over time, closing the feedback loop.
    *   A/B test results are recorded and analyzed by `ab_testing_framework.py`.

#### 3. Key Features and Architectural Patterns

*   **Microservices Architecture**: The ML worker is a separate service (Celery worker) that communicates asynchronously with the main backend, promoting loose coupling and scalability.
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery is used for all ML tasks, ensuring that long-running operations (like model inference or training) do not block the main application.
*   **Model Optimization**: Extensive use of ONNX and quantization for highly efficient, low-latency inference on CPU.
*   **Few-shot Learning**: Enables the model to adapt to new categories or user-specific nuances with minimal examples, reducing the need for large, labeled datasets.
*   **A/B Testing**: Built-in framework for comparing different model versions or configurations in a live production environment, allowing data-driven decisions on model deployment.
*   **Real-time Monitoring**: Integration with Prometheus for continuous monitoring of model performance, resource utilization, and error rates, enabling proactive issue detection and alerting.
*   **Feedback Loop**: A clear mechanism for collecting user feedback and using it to retrain/update the model, ensuring continuous improvement.
*   **Containerization**: Dockerfile provides a reproducible and isolated environment for deploying the ML worker.
*   **Production Readiness**: The `ProductionOrchestrator` encapsulates complex logic for model loading, variant management, and integration with monitoring and A/B testing, making the ML service production-ready.

This ML worker is a sophisticated system designed for high-performance, continuously improving transaction categorization, with robust tools for deployment, monitoring, and experimentation.
