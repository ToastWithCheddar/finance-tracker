# Cross-Cutting Concerns

This document addresses system-wide concerns such as security, performance, and error handling, based on the current state of the codebase.

## 1. Security

*   **Authentication:** The backend uses JWTs for authentication. The `python-jose` and `passlib` libraries are used for handling JWTs and hashing passwords.
*   **CORS:** The backend uses `fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware` to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The `slowapi` library is used to implement rate limiting on the API endpoints.

## 2. Performance

*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The backend uses Celery to run ML tasks asynchronously, which prevents long-running tasks from blocking the main API.
*   **Caching:** Redis is used for caching, which can significantly improve the performance of the application.
*   **Optimized ML Inference:** The use of ONNX suggests that the ML models are optimized for performance.

## 3. Error Handling

*   **Custom Exception Handlers:** The backend has custom exception handlers for `HTTPException`, `RequestValidationError`, and `Exception`. This ensures that errors are handled gracefully and that a standardized error response is returned to the client.
*   **Frontend Error Boundaries:** The frontend uses React error boundaries to prevent the entire application from crashing if a component fails to render.
